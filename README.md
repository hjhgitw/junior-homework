# Tastemade Junior Developer Homework

This assignment includes the four tasks below for you to complete on our dummy video detail page. It should take you no more than 3 to 4 hours to complete. Please don't spend any more time on it than that, for your sanity and ours. We'd like for you to limit your usage of any external resources outside of your knowledge for obvious reasons. Be prepared to go over the ins and outs of your code in person and if you aren't able to get through anything, we'll ask you to go through your thought process to see if we can solve it together.  

## Setup
- Clone [this github repo](https://github.com/tastemade/junior-homework.git) and commit to your own account.
- Run `npm install` and then `npm start` to get the project running. The browser should automatically open with the page. 
- This app was setup with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Check this page if you have any issues getting the site up and running locally. 

## Tasks
- Hook up the play/pause button to toggle the video. Make sure the icon changes based on the corresponding state.
- Style the navigation the best way you see fit. Include a dropdown for the `More` section that activates on hover and deactivates after the mouse leaves the `<li>` container or the dropdown itself.
- Use the data in `src/data/data.json` to create a module at the bottom of the page to showcase the products associated with this video. Include the picture, title, description and price of each product. Start by looking for the `relatedProducts` array in the data.
- Finally, make sure the layout looks good on mobile. Pay close attention to the navigation. A hamburger-style button with a dropdown could be useful.
